        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <p>The process by which all permanent learning takes place, such as playing a musical instrument or learning a different language.
                Makes your brain extremely resilient, and also enables people to recover from stroke, injury.
                Helps create new ways of functioning and behavior for those experiencing autism, ADHD, depression, and addictions
                Far reach implications.

        <h3>Your Brain on Learning</h3>
            <p>Defined as the selective organizing of connections between neurons in our brains.
                In the repetitive practice of activity, their neural networks shape themselves according to that activity or memory.
                When we stop practicing new things, the connecting cells that formed the pathways are eliminated from the brain.
                “Practice makes permanent. The more times the network is stimulated, the stronger and more efficient it becomes” - Willis
                </p>
        <h3>Changing Brains in the Classroom</h3>
            <p>Practice, repeating an activity helps build stronger, more hard-wired connections in the brain
                Whenever new material is presented in such a way that students see relationships, between concepts they generate greater brain cell activity and achieve a more successful long-term memory storage and retrieval
                The realization that they can change their brains through study and review is empowering
                </p>
        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
                <p>Carol Dweck challenges the idea that intelligence is a fixed trait. In a growth mindset, students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching, and persistence.</p>
