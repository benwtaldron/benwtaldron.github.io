        <p>When I was studying game design the final project was a group project where we had to build a escape room game in VR, my technical skills at that point were not very good, and the group came into a bit of tension as I was slowing them down. So I ended up taking a more leadership role, handling all the documentation, delegation, time-management, and the presenting as none of the more technical weren’t interested in handling that side of the project.
