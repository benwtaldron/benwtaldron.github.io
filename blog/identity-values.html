        <h1>Identity Values</h1>
        <p><b>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</b>
            <br>I feel this question is a bit to personal and would rather not talk about ethical or unethical decisions I have made so I shall skip this question.<br>
            <b>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</b><br>
            My mother is from england from scottish heritage, and my dad is from New Zealand. Scottish tradition is one of the things that have been strong mainly when it came to weddings, where all the men would wear kilts.<br>
            <b>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey</b><br>
            My strength is hard work.<br>
            <b>Evaluate your limitation in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</b><br>
            I don’t have a university degree which I have found definitely hinders job prospects, I feel as though this may affect my ability to progress up to higher paying jobs.<br>
            <b>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</b><br>
            When I was studying game design the final project was a group project where we had to build a escape room game in VR, my technical skills at that point were not very good, and the group came into a bit of tension as I was slowing them down. So I ended up taking a more leadership role, handling all the documentation, delegation, time-management, and the presenting as none of the more technical weren’t interested in handling that side of the project.
