        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        <p><b>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</b><br>
I would like to break into the tech industry, this is what I hope to use the dev academy for. Beyond tech, I would like to work in web3 focusing on distributed systems.<br>
<b>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</b><br>
I am really good at finishing the work on time and have been working ahead. A limitation would be when it comes to not understanding the material I sometimes skip over it, often not coming back to it unless it comes up.<br>
<b>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b><br>
Interview skills, interpersonal skills with people. I have good skills when it comes to interacting with people I work with for some reason, but friends and people I meet not so well, lot of it has to do with my setting for me.<br>
<b>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this program</b><br>
Work through projects in chunks, and work ahead so that if I get stuck further ahead I have more time to figure it out.<br>
<b>A commit as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</b><br>
I have been putting messages in discord and talking to some people in the discord community<br>
A description of what to expect from the Facilitation term<br>
Following up, and scheduling times to talk if I can’t make meetings. This has already been happening which has been very helpful.<br>
<b>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</b><br>
It's a bit difficult to schedule times week to week as I have a rotating roster at work that changes week to week. The only big conflict I have is a week-long trip overseas I am taking which I only worry will conflict if it is during a group project, but it should be fine seeing as I will have Wifi<br>
