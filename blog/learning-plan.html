            <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
            <h3>What is your long-term goal/and or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>
                I want to use Dev-Academy as a bridge into the tech industry, then keep learning and working, developing my skills as a coder. Long term I would like to work overseas and end up working in the Web3 space.
            </p>
            <h3>What do you think your biggest strength and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
            <p>
                My biggest strength will be time-management. During the start of foundations, I was working ahead a lot. And I found that even when I was working at the pace, I was completing tasks at a steady pace and didn't feel like I was behind at any point.
            </p>
            <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
            <p>
                Communication. Having to juggle work and study during full-time Bootcamp study will be a challenge, I am working on moving my schedule around so I can be online 5 days a week.

            </p>
            <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills -  would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev-Academy?</h3>
            <p>
                In group projects, I have minimal experience  working on coding projects in groups, I feel as though this will be a fundamental skill in the industry, and I am interested in what the workflow looks like when working in groups

            </p>
            <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
            <p>
                Clear and consistent communication.

            </p>
            <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
            <p>
                Hard work and dedication that's all it comes down to.

            <h1>Foundations Learning Plan</h1>
            
            <h3>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>I would like to break into the tech industry, this is what I hope to use the dev academy for. Beyond tech, I would like to work in web3 focusing on distributed systems.
            </p>
            <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
            <p>I am really good at finishing the work on time and have been working ahead. A limitation would be when it comes to not understanding the material I sometimes skip over it, often not coming back to it unless it comes up.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p>        Interview skills, interpersonal skills with people. I have good skills when it comes to interacting with people I work with for some reason, but friends and people I meet not so well, lot of it has to do with my setting for me.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this program</h3>
            <p>        Work through projects in chunks, and work ahead so that if I get stuck further ahead I have more time to figure it out.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>A commit as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
            </h3>
            <p>I have been putting messages in discord and talking to some people in the discord community</p>
            <h3>A description of what to expect from the Facilitation term</h3>
            <p>Following up, and scheduling times to talk if I canâ€™t make meetings. This has already been happening which has been very helpful.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
            </h3>
            <p>It's a bit difficult to schedule times week to week as I have a rotating roster at work that changes week to week. The only big conflict I have is a week-long trip overseas I am taking which I only worry will conflict if it is during a group project, but it should be fine seeing as I will have Wifi
