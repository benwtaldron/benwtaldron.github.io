        <h1>End of Foundations</h1>
        <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
            Solidified my learning plan. This question is ridiculous, I haven’t learned anything about my ego although me thinking this question is due to my ego, so if I have to answer then I find that if there is a question I don’t like or already think I know, I  to skip it, or just skim through.
        </p>
        <h3>What are values, empathy, and self-awareness roles in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p>
            I think that self-awareness is the most important if you can recognize your own strength and process for solving problems, it makes things a lot easier.
            Empathy is important, when working with other people, you have to be able to recognize and understand their own strenghts and weaknesses.
            Stong values are important in any role.
        </p>
        <h3>What has surprised you the more about the core learning</h3>
        <p>
            The most interesting was the first exercise in sprint-4, Neuroplacisitity and growth mindset
        </p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning</h3>
        <p>
            Pair exercises, and learning in groups are always difficult. This was a struggle, the most difficult however was having to talk about yourself.
        </p>
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course</h3>
        <p>
            It’s all about mentality, all of the core exercises are used to condition our brain to be open to learning, and think like a programmer.
        </p>
        <h3>Does your time studying core learning feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>
            Somewhat, I thought that the structure of foundations would be more traditional in a sense I guess, as in giving material to absorb, and then apply in the later part.
