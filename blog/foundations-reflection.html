        <h1>End of Foundations</h1>
        <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            Solidified my learning plan. This question is ridiculous, I haven’t learned anything about my ego although me thinking this question is due to my ego, so if I have to answer then I find that if there is a question I don’t like or already think I know, I  to skip it, or just skim through.
        </p>
        <h2>What are values, empathy, and self-awareness roles in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>
            I think that self-awareness is the most important if you can recognize your own strength and process for solving problems, it makes things a lot easier
        </p>
        <h2>What has surprised you the more about the core learning</h2>
        <p>
            The most interesting was the first exercise in sprint-4, Neuroplacisitity and growth mindset
        </p>
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning</h2>
        <p>
            Pair exercises, and learning in groups are always difficult. This was a struggle, the most difficult however was having to talk about yourself.
        </p>
        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course</h2>
        <p>
            It’s all about mentality, all of the core exercises are used to condition our brain to be open to learning, and think like a programmer.
        </p>
        <h2>Does your time studying core learning feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p>
            Somewhat, I thought that the structure of foundations would be more traditional in a sense I guess, as in giving material to absorb, and then apply in the later part.
