        <h2>Robber Duck Method</h2>
        <p>
            With this technique you explain a line of code to a rubber duck, this technique is used when a programmer gets held back by bugs. When you encounter bugs, explain the code line by line to a rubber duck, the solution to the bug often presents itself from there.
            <br>Articulating a problem in spoken form. The name of this technique is in reference to a story in the book, The Pragmatic Programmer, in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug code by forcing themselves to explain the code.

        <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
        <p>
            Pseudocode is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm. It is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. The purpose of using pseudocode is that it is ear to understand.
