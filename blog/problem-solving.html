        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
        <h3>Robber Duck Method</h3>
        <p>
            With this technique you explain a line of code to a rubber duck, this technique is used when a programmer gets held back by bugs. When you encounter bugs, explain the code line by line to a rubber duck, the solution to the bug often presents itself from there.
            <br>Articulating a problem in spoken form. The name of this technique is in reference to a story in the book, The Pragmatic Programmer, in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug code by forcing themselves to explain the code.
        </p>
        <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
        <p>
            Pseudocode is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm. It is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. The purpose of using pseudocode is that it is ear to understand.

        <h3>Getting stuck, how you solved a problem and how you feel about all the problem solving methods</h3>
        <p>
            During the replit challenges, thinking through the logic was really important to solving the problems, and alot of the time I got stuck, I used pseudocode before I started a problem, and then practiced the Rubber Duck Method to dedug.
            For example, the first fizzbuzz problem, I feel like I solving elegantly. I wrote the problem out in pseudocode first, then researched some of the methods that
            I would need to solve the problem. Then I wrote with no errors on the first time which was satisfying.
            <br>
            A problem I got stuck on would be the Super Fizzbuzz problem. I wrote the entire problem in pseudocode  first, then researched 
            as I had done before
