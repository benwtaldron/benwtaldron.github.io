        <h3>HTML, JS, CSS</h3>
        <p>What is the relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? HTML is the basic building block of your website, elements such as text, images, buttons, etc. This helps us to build the basic structure of a website. CSS is the tool that we use to style all of the HTML elements, such as changing the font, color, and size of the text, backgrounds, images, etc. Java Script adds functionality to the website, for example, the action that takes place when we press a button or when we submit data in a form, this all happens behind the scenes thanks to Java Script.</p>
        <h3>Control Flow & Loops</h3>
        <p>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes the program in a script. In programming, sometimes we need to execute the block of code repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true. However, loop statements are used to execute the instructions in a repeated order. The execution of the set of instructions depends upon a particular condition. A loop is a type of control flow. An example of something in real life that relates to control flow is anything that we might do in sequential order, for example making a bed, or making a sandwich.</p>
        <h3>DOM</h3>
        <p>DOM (Document Object Model) is a langue-independent interface that treats HTML elements as a tree structure. The DOM represents the document as a logical tree, in which using DOM methods allow access to the tree. With DOM methods we can change the content, style, and structure of a document.
        </p>
        <h3>Arrays & Objects</h3>
        <p>Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. You can access an element in an array by referring to an index number.
            <br>
            Java is an object-orientated programming language, everything in java is associated with classes and objects, for example, a car would be an object, but it also has attributes, such as weight and color. Objects in javascript work the same way. You can access object properties in two ways:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>objectName.propertyName</p>
        <p>Or</p>
        <p>objectName["propertyName"]</3>
        <h3>Functions</h2>
        <p>A javascript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A function is executed when it is called. Functions are useful because we can reuse the code: Define the code once, and use it multiple times. You can use the same code in different arguments to produce different results.
